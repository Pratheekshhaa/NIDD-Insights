# UML Diagram Generator

An interactive web-based tool for generating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and Paremeterized Relation diagram: "Easily uploads structured Excel files and generate clean, well-organized UML class diagrams automatically."

---

## Aim:

-  Upload Excel files containing class definitions
-  Automatically parse class names, attributes, and methods
-  Render clean UML Class Diagrams, Parameterized Diagram
-  Lightweight, fast, and responsive
-  No data is uploaded — all processing happens locally in the browser

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**:
- Python, Flask and their related libraries, Pandas, Watch dog and their related libraries , Os Library, and Openpyxl Libraries .
- SheetJS library:for reading Excel files

### ⚙️ Prerequisites & Run Instructions
Install all the required Libraries
```bash
# Check for updated Python Version, else download the latest version:
python --version

# Download The Python Libraries:
pip install flask pandas openpyxl

# Run the command in Command prompt (Cmd) Terminal:
python main.py

```

## Methodology:
we are taking a database and analyzing all the data in that given database.
further after analyzing we are creating a uml diagram that shows the relationship between the class and parameters. 
they are also color coded based on the modifications; furthermore they are addressed in a uml diagram that shows the depth of the relation
